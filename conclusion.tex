%Discuss which recipes worked and why. Discuss the importance of semantic representation, scaling features and multi-modality.
In this paper, we try to capture the underlying structure of human communication by jointly considering visual and language cues. We experimentally validate that given a large-video collection having subtitles, it is possible to discover activities without any supervision over activities or objects. Experimental evaluation also suggests the available noisy and incomplete information is powerful enough to not only discover activities but also describe them.

Discovering such structure from videos is useful for many applications including surveillance, robotics, and online video search.  In future work, we plan to share the learned knowledge from videos with robots
using RoboBrain~\cite{robobrain}.
