%Discuss which recipes worked and why. Discuss the importance of semantic representation, scaling features and multi-modality.
In this paper, we try to capture the underlying structure of human communication by jointly considering visual and language cues. We experimentally validate that given a large-video collection having subtitles, it is possible to discover activities without any supervision over activities or objects. Experimental evaluation also suggests the available noisy and incomplete information is powerful enough to not only discover activities but also describe them. We also think that the resulting discovered knowledge can be effectively in many domains like multimedia interfaces and robot knowledge bases \cite{robobrain}.
