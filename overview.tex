In this section, we explain the high-level components of our method which we visualize in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}. Our proposed method consists of three major components; \textbf{(1) Online query and filtering:} Our system starts with querying the YouTube with an \emph{How to} question, and records the top 100 resulting videos. In order to detect the similarity of the videos quickly, we also process the text descriptions of the returned videos, and we represent them as bag-of-words. We further use these representations in order to create a video graph and also to eliminate outliers. \textbf{(2) Frame-wise multi-modal representation:} In order to semantically represent the spatio-temporal information in the videos, we process both the visual and language content of each video. We extract the region proposals and jointly cluster them to detect semantic visual objects. For the language descriptions, we detect the salient words of the corpus generated by the concatenation of the subtitles. We finally represent the each frame in terms of the resulting objects and salient words. \textbf{(3) Unsupervised joint clustering:} After describing the each frame by using the salient objects and words, we apply a non-parametric Bayesian method in order to find the temporally consistent clusters (collection of video clips) occurring over multiple videos. We expect these clusters to correspond to the fine-grained activities which construct the recipes/high level activities. Moreover, our empirical results suggest that the resulting clusters significantly correlates with the fine-grained activities.

We now explain the details of the each sub-system in the following sections.
